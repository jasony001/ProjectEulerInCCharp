Emergency Account Recovery Key

Your random key has been successfully generated and it is displayed below. The server only stores a hash of your key in the database (using PHP's native password hashing algorithm), which means that once you leave this page it is not possible to display the key again.

It is your own responsibility to make a careful note of your emergency account recovery key before navigating away from this page and to ensure that you keep it in a secure location. It is highly recommended that you also record the date/time stamp as this information will be visible on your Account page and can be used to confirm that the key you have is still active. If you suspect that your key has been compromised, you can generate a new one, but please be aware that the previous key will no longer work.
How do I use it?

If you forget or lose your username/password, you will find a link on the Sign In page that allows you to begin the process of recovering your account. After clicking the link you will need to copy and paste your recovery key and enter a CAPTCHA to complete the process. If the key is valid, you will be reminded of your username and issued with a new temporary password. Alternatively, you can use the direct link, which will take you directly to the account recovery page and automatically populate the recovery key box with your key.
